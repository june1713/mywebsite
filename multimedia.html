          „a dancing human being with wings“
          is the prompt used by an artificial intelligence to generate the creature explored in this work. 
          The installation invites viewers to engage with questions of creation, imagination, and the intersection of utopia and dystopia.
          Who sculpted you? Whose imagination is the source of your appearance? I look at you with fascination and fear. In you, I see utopia and dystopia united. 
          You seem to have fallen from the sky, magically created in seconds. But it wasn’t like that. Was it? 
          As I develop and work with you, I ask myself: Can I uncover what is behind your shell? Is there something? Do you know the answer?
